# cvHeadPose #

OpenCV function for 6DOF head pose tracking

## Install

CvHeadPose builds as shared object. To build type:

  $ make 

If everything goes ok, libcvhp.so should be present in lib/ directory.

##  Samples

To build samples, you need OpenCV >= 2.3. In addition,
if you want to build 3D Head Pose Demo, you need
OpenGL and libGLUT developement files, and OpenCV
build with GTK support.

To build all samples type:
  $ make samples

You can always build specific sample:
  $ make SAMPLE_NAME
  e.g.: 
  $ make 2DHeadPose

You can see available samples in samples/ directory
